4) Utilize h1 to h6 tags and paragraph tags with suitable formatting to enhance the visual appeal of the content.
5) Incorporate 3 images with varying dimensions ensuring consistent width and height. Alignment may vary, focusing on maintaining visual appeal.
6) Apply a background pattern using an image from Subtle PatternLinks to an external site. and repeating it across the page as a background.
7) Use an external CSS file named styles.css to organize and manage your styles.

*First Project HTML/CSS Project for MTECH's Web Programming and Development course*

Objective: 
Match the design given - see mihealth-mockdesign-outline for design with my original outline edits. 
Purpose is to match the design as closely as possible. This is currently not a very responsive design, but we can come back later once we've covered more topics and update this webpage to incorporate more advanced methods.

Upload to github and host on github pages

Developer's Thoughts:
This was a fun project with lots of opportunities to review how I structured the page and styled each element. Defintely a lot of room for improvement to go back and incorporate a more responsive page which may include mobile and tablet views. Will also be interested in coming back and seeing how my implementation of CSS has evolved over time. I've always found CSS and selecting appropriate attributes somewhat difficult and time consuming.
